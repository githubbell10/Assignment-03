User enters name and presses the "Let's Play button"

*Instructions*

Press and hold "Space Bar" to charge the plunger, when the progression bar that follows the path of the ball gets to the top let go of the button. Use the left and right arrows to actuate the flippers and keep the ball moving. 


Changes made
1. The number of balls is limited to 3 for each game. After the third one no more are created.
2. The flippers' static position where the hinge is was moved closer to the side bumbers to keep the ball from getting stuck.
3. The gravity and drag were turned way down on the 4 vertical bumpers due to the over amount of force that would shoot the ball out past the flippers too quickly.
4. I made a duplicate of the billboard 3d text mesh to get the players' name to appear but I could not figure out how to get it to retrieve the user name.
5. I remembered to fill out README file this time.
